# Interactive 3D AI Assistant

Welcome to the **Interactive 3D AI Assistant**, a project that brings a conversational AI to life in a 3D environment. This application combines a powerful language model with a fully animated avatar, creating an engaging and interactive user experience. Speak to the avatar through your microphone, and it will listen, think, and respond to you using a custom-cloned voice, complete with real-time animations and 'lip-sync'.

The entire project is designed to be **concurrent**, highly customizable, **100% free**, and runs easily in a Google Colab notebook if you don´t have a graphic card , making it accessible from any web browser without local setup..

## ✨ Core Features

- **🎤 Voice Interaction** Engage in seamless conversations. The assistant listens to your voice, transcribes it to text, and generates a spoken response.
- **🧠 Conversational AI** Powered by the Google Gemini API, the assistant can hold natural, context-aware conversations and remember previous parts of your dialogue for a more personalized experience.
- **🗣️ Custom Voice Cloning** Using OpenVoice, the assistant can clone the timbre of any voice from a reference audio file (`reference.mp3`), giving your character a unique vocal identity.
- **💃 Interactive 3D Avatar** The frontend, built with Three.js, renders a custom `.vrm` avatar. The character features idle and talking animations, automatic blinking, and audio-driven lip-sync.
- **🎨 Fully Customizable** Easily swap out the avatar (`.vrm`), animations (`.fbx`), 3D background (`.hdr`), reference voice (`.mp3`), and the AI’s personality to create your own unique assistant.
- **🌐 Web-Accessible** Runs in a Google Colab notebook and uses Ngrok to generate a public URL, allowing you to access the assistant from your browser on any device.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Gather Your Assets** Before you begin, you will need all the necessary 3D and audio files. You can use your own or download them from the recommended sources below.
- **3D Avatar** (`waifu.vrm`)
- **Animations** (`idle.fbx`, `anim_1.fbx`, `anim_2.fbx`, `anim_3.fbx`)
- **3D Background** (`background.hdr`)
- **Reference Voice** (`reference.mp3`)
- **Web Client** (`cliente_final.html`)

2. **Prepare Your Files** Create a single `.zip` file containing all the assets from the previous step. The Colab notebook will prompt you to upload this file.

3. **Set Up the Environment** - Open the `main.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
   - Run the **General Environment Setup** cells to install all required dependencies and libraries.

4. **Configure Your Keys and Personality** In the **API Key, AI Personality & Language Configuration** cell, enter your keys:
   ```python
   GOOGLE_API_KEY = "<your_google_api_key>"
   NGROK_AUTHTOKEN = "<your_ngrok_authtoken>"
   ```
   Also customize the AI's personality by editing `SYSTEM_PROMPT_EN` or `SYSTEM_PROMPT_ES`.
   Run the cell, and it will prompt you to upload the `.zip` file you created in Step 2.

5. **Launch the Server** Run the final cell: **Run Web Server & Application**.
   This will start the web server and generate a public Ngrok URL in the output. Open that URL in your browser to start interacting with your assistant!
